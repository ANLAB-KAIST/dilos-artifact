DHCP IPoIB support for dhcp-4.2.4.P2-0.16.15.src.rpm

Build Procedure:

1. Have the rpmbuild command use another directory (e.g., /home/your_userid/rpm)
by putting this line in a file called .rpmmacros in your home directory:

%_topdir /home/your_userid/rpm

2. Create the following subdirectories in that directory:

cd /home/your_userid/rpm
mkdir SOURCES SPECS BUILD SRPMS
mkdir -p RPMS/i386 RPMS/i486 RPMS/i586 RPMS/i686 RPMS/x86_64 RPMS/noarch

3. Install the .src.rpm file this way:

rpm -i dhcp-<ver>.src.rpm

This will create files in the SOURCES directory of your RPM building directory tree, and a .spec file in the SPECS directory.

4. Copy the 0001-dhcp-4.2.4p2-lpf-ip-over-ib-support.patch and 0002-dhcp-4.2.4p2-improved-xid.patch to /home/your_userid/rpm/SOURCES

5. apply dhcp.spec.diff to dhcp.spec via patch command (patch -p1 -i dhcp.spec.diff)

6. Go the SPECS directory and give the command to build the RPM:

cd /home/your_userid/rpm/SPECS
rpmbuild --define '%_topdir /home/your_userid/rpm' -bb dhcp.spec

NOTE: The build should be performed on a machine with the appropriate distro.
With SLES(11), the build will not succeed without doing this.
