openibd post-start-hook example:

This is an example of a script that will be ran automatically by openibd service script after driver
has been loaded. The script will run '/bin/mlnx_interface_mgr.sh' on all interfaces related to
Mellanox devices in order to configure them (run ifup, etc...).

To apply the hook script, copy 'post-start-hook.sh' to '/etc/infiniband/' and mark it as executable:
# cp post-start-hook.sh /etc/infiniband/post-start-hook.sh
# chmod +x /etc/infiniband/post-start-hook.sh

The openibd service script will automatically detect it and run it.
