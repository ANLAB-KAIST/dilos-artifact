     - Number of HCAs
     - Host driver version
     - Host architecture type
     - Node GUIDs of HCAs
     - Number of active HCA ports
     - State of HCA ports

    Output of system checks includes the results of following items:
     - Are there  HCAs in the system?
     - Has the driver been initialized?
     - Are the programmed firmware versions on HCAs up-to-date?
     - Are there RPMs on the host driver?
     - Does the kernel sys log contain error messages (kernel oops/panic or
