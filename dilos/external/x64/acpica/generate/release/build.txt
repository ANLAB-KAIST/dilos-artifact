Instructions to create a full release of the ACPICA software
and utilities.

Last update 18 October 2012.

The build uses MS Visual Studio and Cygwin to accomplish the
goal of releasing both Windows and Unix versions of the ACPICA code
and utilities. For Windows, binary versions of the ACPICA utilities
(including the iASL compiler) are created.


Build the ACPICA Software
-------------------------

Cleanup any extraneous files in the local git tree

Complete any updates to the ACPICA documentation (ACPICA ref, iASL ref)
Create the .PDF versions of the .DOC files
Checkin any changed documents

Update the version number (form 0xyyyymmdd) in source/include/acpixf.h
Build Windows debug versions of all software and utilities
Build Windows nodebug versions of all software and utilities
    (generate/msvc9)
Build Unix versions of all software and utilities
    (generate/unix/make)

Write the release notes
Generate sizes for the acpica library from generate/release/size.bat
   Note: This step uses MS dumpbin(link) which is a part of the VC package.
   It might not work unless the environment variables are set correctly.
   Execute VC/vcvarsall.bat from the command line if necessary.
Sizes appear in the files size_rel.txt and size_dbg.txt
Integrate code/data and debug/nodebug sizes into the release notes
Add the release notes to the documents/changes.txt document
   Note: From Word, use "Save As", then check MS-DOS and "insert line breaks"
   boxes before saving.

Checkin documents/changes.txt
Checkin the new version number, source/include/acpixf.h
Git push everything

Tag the version file with a name of the form Rmm_dd_yy
    git tag -m"version yyyymmdd" Rmm_dd_yy <commit #>
    git push --tags

Build the various tar/zip release files:
    Convert the generate/release/.sh files to unix format: dos2unix *.sh
    On cygwin, execute generate/release/release.sh (sh release.sh)
