// condvar is OSv's implementation of the classic "condition variable"
// synchronization primitive. It is similar to condition variables in POSIX
// Threads, but makes one additional guarantees that POSIX Threads do not:
// Our condvar_wait() is guaranteed not to have "spurious wakeups", i.e.,
// condvar_wait() will only return if someone called condvar_wake_one()/all().
//
// The difference is subtle. Usually you still need to check the condition
// after condvar_wait() returns because other threads may race us to change
// the condition. But in some cases we use this guarantee. One example is our
// semaphore implementation (semaphore.cc): In the traditional implementation
// when spurious condvar_wait wakeups are possible, the wakee decrements the
// semaphore's counter (this can cause a "thundering herd" problem). Using
// our condvar without spurious wakeups, it is possible to decrement the
// counter in the waker, and decide exactly who to wake.
//
// So watch out - if this implementation is ever rewritten, it should continue
// to guarantee no-spurious-wakeups - even if POSIX Threads doesn't need it.
