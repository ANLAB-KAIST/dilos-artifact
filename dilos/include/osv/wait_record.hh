// A "waiter" is simple synchronization object, with which one thread calling
// waiter->wait() goes to sleep, and a second thread, which finds this waiter
// on some wait-queue, wakes it up with waiter->wake().
//
// A waiter->wake() is guaranteed to stop or avoid the wait of waiter->wait(),
// no matter which came before which, or even if the two race. And conversely,
// when wake->wait() returns, this can only happen when waker->wake() was
// called, and cannot happen because of a spurious wakeup.
//
// waiter is a single-use object - each of wake() and wait() can only be
// called once on it.
//
// waiter behaves similarly to the familiar "event semaphore" synchronization
// mechanism (e.g., see Event objects in Python and in Microsoft Windows),
// except that waiter is limited to a single waiting thread.
