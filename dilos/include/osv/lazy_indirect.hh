// A lazy_indirect<T> is a small object (8 bytes) which pretends to contain
// an object of arbitrarily-sized type T, while actually allocating one
// dynamically only on first use. This allocation is done in a thread-safe
// manner, even if several threads race to use the object first.
// T should have a default (zero-argument) constructor.
//
// lazy_indirect<T>'s constructor merely zeros the object's 8 bytes, so
// it is ok to cast zeroed memory to lazy_indirect<T> - see an example
// of this use in pthread.cc. However, remember in this case to call
// the lazy_indirect<T>::~lazy_indirect eventually, otherwise the memory used
// to allocate T will leak.
