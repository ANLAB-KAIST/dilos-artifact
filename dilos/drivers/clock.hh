 * OSv low-level time-keeping interface
 *
 * This is an abstract class providing an interface to OSv's basic
 * time-keeping functions.
 *
 * clock::get() returns the single concrete instance of this interface,
 * which may be a kvmclock, xenclock, or hpetclock - depending on which
 * of these the hypervisor provides. This clock instance may then be
 * queried for the current time - for example, clock::get()->time().
 *
 * The methods of this class are not type-safe, in that they return times
 * as unadorned integers (s64) whose type does not specify the time units
 * or the epoch. Prefer instead to use the types from <osv/clock.hh>:
 * osv::clock::uptime et al. Their efficiency is identical to the
 * methods of this class, but they allow much better compile-time checking.

     * when a paravirtual clock is available (kvmclock or xenclock), time
