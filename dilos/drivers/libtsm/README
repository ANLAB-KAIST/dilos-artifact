TSM is a Terminal-emulator State Machine. It implements all common DEC-VT100
to DEC-VT520 control codes and features. A state-machine is used to parse TTY
input and saved in a virtual screen. TSM does not provide any rendering,
glyph/font handling or anything more advanced. TSM is just a simple
state-machine for control-codes handling.
The main use-case for TSM are terminal-emulators. TSM has no dependencies
other than an ISO-C99 compiler and C-library. Any terminal emulator for any
window-environment or rendering-pipline can make use of TSM. However, TSM can
also be used for control-code validation, TTY-screen-capturing or other
advanced users of terminal escape-sequences.
