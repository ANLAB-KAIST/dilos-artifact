This is an example of simple HTTP server implemented in Golang.
The app listens on port 8000.

In order to build the app you need to install Golang.

./scripts/build image=golang-httpserver
./scripts/run.py --forward tcp:8000::8000

You can open it in a browser by typing this URL:
http://localhost:8000/

or hit from command line using curl:
curl http://localhost:8000/
