## NewRelic Java client
Here is how to add a newrelic agent to your Java application
[tomcat is used as an example]

build an image, adding java-newrelic to the image:
```
make image=tomcat,java-newrelic
```

go back to /app/java-newrelic, and update newrelic.yml
In particular you MUST update: 
* the following line using your newrelic licence

*license_key: '<%= license_key %>'*
* and the following line with your application name 

*app_name: My Application*

build again
```
make image=tomcat,java-newrelic
```

and run you app locally
```
sudo ./scripts/run.py -n
```
or upload it to the cloud.
You should see your application metric one you log into your newrelic account.
