This is an example of simple HTTP server implemented in Rust using futures. The code is
based on the example found here - https://hyper.rs/guides/server/hello-world/.
The app listens on port 3000.

In order to build the app you need to install Rust tool chain (compiler + cargo)
by following instructions here: https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html.

./scripts/build image=rust-httpserver
./scripts/run.py --forward tcp:3000::3000

You can open it in a browser by typing this URL:
http://localhost:8000/cli/

or hit from command line using curl:
curl http://localhost:3000/
