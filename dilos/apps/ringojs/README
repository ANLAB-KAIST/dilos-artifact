RingoJS is a JavaScript runtime written in Java based on Mozilla Rhino.
It adds a number of features to Rhino that make it suitable for real-world, large-scale application development:
- A fast, auto-reloading, and CommonJS-compliant module loader.
- A rich set of modules covering I/O, logging, development tools and much more.
- Scalable HTTP server based on the Jetty project.
- Support for CommonJS packages to install or write additional software components.
