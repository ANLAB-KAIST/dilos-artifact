This new HTML5 app is implemented in Typescript and served by OSv httpserver
same way as OSv gui. It provides command line terminal functionality in your
favorite webbrowser and the supported set of commands is identical to the one
supported by OSv cli module. The app depends on httpserver-cli OSv module
and external project https://github.com/wkozaczuk/osv-html5-terminal.git.

You can build and run it a standalone:
./scripts/build image=httpserver-html5-cli.fg

Or add it to you favorite app:
./scripts/build image=elasticsearch,httpserver-html5-cli

You can open it in a browser by typing this URL:
http://localhost:8000/cli/

(when running with scripts/run.py --api; Or replace "localhost" with the VM's
address)
