This module is an example of using the unmodified ImageMagick libraries
taken from the build machine.

We compile a trivial "convert" main using the host's ImageMagick libraries,
and run "convert --help".

On Fedora 21, this seems to work. But on other systems we have seen problems
with the libgomp (gcc's OpenMP) shared library used by ImageMagick - which
ends up calling the system call instruction (see OSv issue #590) and is
compiled with stack protection (see OSv issue #589).
