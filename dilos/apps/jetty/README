This is an example of running Jetty on OSv.

The default command line (set in module.py) runs Jetty's demo app,
which listens on port 8080 and provides all sorts of silly examples and
tests. Clearly, a real user of jetty will want to run a different
servlet, and might not need all the stuff we put (see usr.manifest)
in the image - which currently includes the demo, a gazillion libraries,
etc.
