This package provides terminfo definition for the "unknown" terminal type,
which is ncurses's default if TERM is missing.

Currently, we copy the host's "xterm" definition, as that is a fairly
common terminal nowadays and will "probably" work for a user with a modern
Linux terminal, although perhaps we should choose a more bare-bones VT100
definition instead.

However, QEMU has a long-standing (11 years!) bug which wrongly translates
a bare linefeed sent by the guest \n\r - see
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1407813
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/qemu/+bug/1715296

So we need to modify the host's terminfo files use to avoid using \n for
moving the cursor directly down - because in qemu it doesn't (the extra
\r causes the cursor to move to the *beginning* of that line).
