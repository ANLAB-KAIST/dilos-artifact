//
// The Read-Only File System (ROFS) provides simple implementation of
// a file system where data from disk can only be read from and never
// written to. It is simple enough for many stateless applications
// deployed on OSv which only need to read code from local disk and never
// write to local disk. The ROFS is inspired and shares some ideas
// from the original MFS implementation by James Root from 2015.
//
// The ROFS can operate in two modes - without cache and with cache.
// Without cache ROFS reads as much data from disk as requested
// per uio passed in to the read function but it does not retain/cache it
// for any subsequent read of the same data. Conversely in cache mode
// ROFS reads more data from disk than needed per uio and stores it in memory
// in anticipation there will be more subsequent contiguous reads of data.
// By default ROFS operates in cache-mode but can be changed to non-cache
// by passing '--disable_rofs_cache' boot option.
//
// Specifically ROFS cache mode implements simple "read-around" strategy by
// dividing a file into same size (32K) segments and reading entire segment
// into memory when corresponding offset of file is requested. Files smaller
// than 32K are loaded in full on first read. This simple read-around strategy
// can achieve 80-90% cache hit ratio in many conducted measurements. Also it can
// deliver 2-3 increase of read speed over non-cache mode at some cost of
// too much unneeded data read (15-20%). Lastly the loaded data stays
// in memory forever as there is no LRU logic implemented that could limit
// memory used.
//
// The structure of the data on disk is explained in scripts/gen-rofs-img.py
