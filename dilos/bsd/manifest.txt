FreeBSD Networking Stack.

This directory has an OSv port of the FreeBSD networking stack, specifically: 
- Interface management
- Routing
- Protocol stack
- Socket layer

Files under sys/ were taken from FreeBSD 9.0/ trunk revision r245665 (svn)
With modifications so they can work in OSv.

Files under machine/ can be found in FreeBSD at sys/amd64/include/
This directory should be ditched eventually.

The directory structure of FreeBSD is preserved, for ease of use.

Files under the porting/ directory contain stubs, OSv implementations of the
different utils and primitives the networking stack use and various wrappers.
