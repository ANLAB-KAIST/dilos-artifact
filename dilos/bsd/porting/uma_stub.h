 * What's the difference between initializing and constructing?

 * The item is initialized when it is cached, and this is the state that the

 * to remove some code which would otherwise be called on each allocation by
 * utilizing a known, stable state.  This differs from the constructor which
 * will be called on EVERY allocation.
 *
 * For example, in the initializer you may want to initialize embedded locks,
 * NULL list pointers, set up initial states, magic numbers, etc.  This way if
 * the object is held in the allocator and re-used it won't be necessary to
 * re-initialize it.
 *
 * The constructor may be used to lock a data structure, link it on to lists,
 * bump reference counts or total counts of outstanding structures, etc.
