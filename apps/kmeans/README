This app builds an image containing the already-compiled Python shared
object for Python 3.x (libpython3.7.so for example) installed on the build machine,
and some of the required libraries from the build machine.

In order to build this app you need to have Python development package
installed for your distribution. Examples how to do it:
sudo apt-get install python3-dev # On Ubuntu
sudo dnf install python3-devel   # On Fedora

The python home directory is assumed to be installed under
<sys.prefix>/lib/python<sys.version_info.major>.<sys.version_info.minor>/
where sys is Python package this script reads the sys.* values from.

Please note that any extra modules found under site-packages or dist-packages
directories are filtered out from the image. You can add extra modules by editing
the PYTHON_MODULES variable in the GET script.

Example usage:

./scripts/run.py -e "/python3"
./scripts/run.py --api -e "/python3 -c \"aa={1:22,3:44}; print(aa); print('asdf')\""
./scripts/run.py --api -e "/python3 -m http.server 8000"
